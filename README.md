# CSE-4471-Project 
Polymorphic Virus & Countermeasures

This repository contains the code for the xichigan virus and an antivirus software suite. 

The xichigan virus is copied to the target computer from a flashdrive and edits files on the desktop by replacing 'm' and 'M' characters with an 'X.' The mutation engine is also copied to the target computer to encrypt and morph the virus, making it polymorphic. An Ohio State-themed game is used to disguise the virus download onto the target computer, but was too large to store with the virus files.

The antivirus software suite is a simplified implementation of antivirus software that consists of three programs to monitor directories for suspicious processes or files. This system detects, and alerts, logs, and reacts to virus attacks.
